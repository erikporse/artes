This folder contains groundwater-related files used in studies with Artes or in developing the LA Water Hub
The groundwater basin shape files are used for visualizing data on the LA Water Hub (http://waterhub.ucla.edu)

Complete groundwater basin shape file repositories for LA County were derived from two locations: 
1) LA County GIS Database
2) DWR Bulletin 118

Both are mapped on the Water Hub and included here.

The shape file data with jurisdictional boundaries is provided for the Water Replenishment District of Southern California

Shape files are also available from Watermasters of each adjudicated groundwater area.

Finally, shape files are included for:
1) groundwater wells (point files) associated with public water system retailers in LA County. These are provided as a .csv file
2) Spreading grounds managed by LA County
